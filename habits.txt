The first tip I find very important to such an extent, that I also follow these microrules. 
I try to get enough movement - not possible everyday but as often as I can. Also fresh air is important along with drinking preferably water - 
not sweet and sugary stuff. 

#2
The get it done attitude is a good way to approach programming and work in general. 
Start everything on time - it gives you freedom later on. 

Also being flexible about which work station I work on is OK, but I think that
productivity can be increased when you configure your shortcuts etc.

#3
Keeping code simple and easy to read is in my opinion a must have nowadays.
I myself have come across chaotic code that was incredibly hard to work on. 

#4
Habit number 4 - being in the zone.
Being in the zone is a great way to get work done. Frequent interuptions have "harmed" me in the past,
where I wasn't able to fully concentrate on my work. Being in the zone is a very productive state of mind 
for a programmer - however it contradicts the statement that was mentioned in the video in the first habit - 
taking breaks from staring into the computer.

#5
The IT world is improving and advancing incredibly quickly - so in order to stay up-to-date 
and work ready it is necessary to keep on learning.

#6
Collaboration and being a team player definitely brings more benefits than being a solo programmer.
It is not a shame to ask for help and it can also be a learning experience as other people
may have newer and better solutions for some problems and bugs.
