Habit number 4 - being in the zone.
Being in the zone is a great way to get work done. Frequent interuptions have "harmed" me in the past,
where I wasn't able to fully concentrate on my work. Being in the zone is a very productive state of mind 
for a programmer - however it contradicts the statement that was mentioned in the video in the first habit - 
taking breaks from staring into the computer.
