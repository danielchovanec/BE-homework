The first tip I find very important to such an extent, that I also follow these microrules. 
I try to get enough movement - not possible everyday but as often as I can. Also fresh air is important along with drinking preferably water - 
not sweet and sugary stuff. 

#2
The get it done attitude is a good way to approach programming and work in general. 
Start everything on time - it gives you freedom later on. 

Also being flexible about which work station I work on is OK, but I think that
productivity can be increased when you configure your shortcuts etc.

#3
Keeping code simple and easy to read is in my opinion a must have nowadays.
I myself have come across chaotic code that was incredibly hard to work on.
